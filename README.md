ü™û Reflection Example (STAR Method)

Situation: I recently completed a formative assessment on "Workplace Etiquette" as part of my professional development. The assessment consisted of several multiple-choice questions designed to test knowledge of professional conduct, including communication, punctuality, and handling confidential information.

Task:My objective was to successfully complete the assessment, achieving a high score by demonstrating a strong understanding of standard workplace protocols and professional behavior. 

Action:I dedicated approximately 48 minutes to the assessment, carefully reading each question. I applied my existing knowledge of professional norms to answer questions about appropriate email etiquette, the importance of arriving on time for meetings, proper handling of confidential data, and the boundaries between personal and work responsibilities. I attempted 100% of the questions.

Result:I successfully completed the assessment and received a final mark of 100%. However, the detailed breakdown reveals a significant discrepancy: while the overall module is marked "Complete" with a 100% score, every individual question was scored at 0%. This unusual result suggests a potential technical issue with the grading system. Despite this, the process was a valuable exercise in reviewing and affirming my understanding of fundamental workplace etiquette, which I can confidently apply in a professional setting.

üìù Conclusion

As I transition into the professional world, I carry with me a proven ability to communicate effectively, interview confidently, network strategically, and maintain professional etiquette - ready to contribute meaningfully to any tech team and embrace lifelong learning in this dynamic industry.
